= Lead Generation Platform LGP
This platform is a tool to generate consumer interest or inquiry into a specified products or services of a business. In this case I'd like to provide a flexible system to startup a web app for retrieve estimate request from users and deliver them automatically to the business company that operate in a specified field. With this we'd like to promote the local business.

Each company has those attributes:
* area of competence: rapresents the geographic area (like country or province) where the company can work
* categories: rapresents the fields where the company works (like plumber, mason and so on...)

== EXAMPLE 
You can find a version of this app in production mode at http://www.matrimonioidee.it

== Admin user backend functionality
As admin you can:
* edit page for the frontend, all the pages are shipped with editable SEO proprieties like meta key, meta description, permalink and so on
* edit post into for the blog
* edit question for Q&A system
* edit business company
* edit company's categories that rapresent the company skill 
* manage the estimates send to the companies
* manage contacts subscribed from newsletter module

== Company user backend functionality
As company you can:
* edit your companies 
* choosing categories for the company
* choosing area of competence for the company 
* edit post into the blog, at the end of the post will appear you company information
* visualize the estimates sent to the company

== Guest user frontend functionality
As guest you can:
* create new questions
* reply to question
* comment out the post
* authentication is handled with http://www.janrain.com/


== Frontend functionality
* user can send estimate request to X companies by selecting the categories where he's interested
  * will be selected all the companies with the same area of competence and categories pointed out by the user, data will be stored and an email will be sent at the companies
* user can show companies on the map and look out the detail

== Frontend templating
Right now, there is no template system for it, all the frontend views are located into app/view/frontends and app/view/layouts/frontends and are handled by frontends_controller.rb . You need to modify manually those files.

== SETUP
change the settings into database.yml, named routes into routes.rb and run
 
  bundle install
  rake db:migrate
  rake leadgeneration:import_departments
  rake leadgeneration:import_cities
  rake leadgeneration:create_admin
  rails s
  
open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:3000/users/sign_in

== TODO
* write more test
* create a default frontend template 
* add english translation for backend, just in italian right now
